jaxws-ejb: An EJB JAX-WS Web Service
==================================================
Author: R Searls  
Level: Beginner  
Technologies: JAX-WS  
Summary: The `jaxws-ejb` quickstart is a working example of the web service endpoint created from an EJB.  
Target Product: ${product.name}  
Source: <${github.repo.url}>  

What is it?
-----------

The `jaxws-ejb` quickstart demonstrates the use of *JAX-WS* in ${product.name.full} as a simple EJB web service application.

System requirements
-------------------

The application this project produces is designed to be run on ${product.name.full} ${product.version} or later. 

All you need to build this project is ${build.requirements}. See [Configure Maven for ${product.name} ${product.version}](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN_JBOSS_EAP7.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.


Use of ${jboss.home.name}
---------------

In the following instructions, replace `${jboss.home.name}` with the actual path to your ${product.name} installation. The installation path is described in detail here: [Use of ${jboss.home.name} and JBOSS_HOME Variables](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_${jboss.home.name}.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables).


Start the ${product.name} Server
----------------------         

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the ${product.name} directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server:

        For Linux:   ${jboss.home.name}/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows: ${jboss.home.name}\bin\standalone.bat


Build and Deploy the Quickstart
-------------------------

1. Make sure you have started the ${product.name} server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

        mvn clean install wildfly:deploy

4. This will deploy `service/target/${project.artifactId}-service.war` to the running instance of the server.

Access the application 
---------------------

You can check that the Web Service is running and deployed correctly by accessing the following URL: <http://localhost:8080/${project.artifactId}/EJB3Bean?wsdl>. This URL will display the deployed WSDL endpoint for the Web Service.

Run the Client
--------------
1. Make sure the service deployed properly.

2. Open a command prompt and navigate into the client directory of this quickstart.

        cd client/
3. Type this command to run the client.
     
        mvn exec:java    
4. You should see the following output in the client console.
   
        EJB3Bean returning: ejbClient calling

Undeploy the Archive
--------------------

1. Make sure you have started the ${product.name} server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:

        mvn wildfly:undeploy


Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse
-------------------------------------
You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a ${product.name} server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see [Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts](${use.eclipse.url}). 


Debug the Application
------------------------------------

If you want to debug the source code of any library in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository. The IDE should then detect it.

    mvn dependency:sources

_Note:_ You will see the following informational messages. This is because the source files for these JARs are not available in the Maven repository. The `jboss-jaxws-ejb-service` source files are available in the `jaxws-ejb` project.
