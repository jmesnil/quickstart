[abstract]
The `microprofile-health` quickstart demonstrates the use of the MicroProfile Health
specification in {productName}.

:standalone-server-type: default
:archiveType: jar
:archiveName: {artifactId}-service

== What is it?

MicroProfile Health allows applications to provide information about their state
to external viewers which is typically useful in cloud environments where automated
processes must be able to determine whether the application should be discarded
or restarted.

== Architecture

In this quickstart, we have a simple REST application that exposes MicroProfile Health
functionalities at the `/health/live` and `/health/ready` endpoints according to the
specification.

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the
application step by step. However, you can go right to the completed example which
is available in this directory.

. Start your {productName} server

. Compile the application code and deploy it to {productName}
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package wildfly:deploy
----

// Start the {productName} Standalone Server
include::../shared-doc/start-the-standalone-server.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

=== Running the health check

The {productName} server directly exposes three REST endpoints:

- `/health/live` - The application is up and running.
- `/health/ready` - The application is ready to serve requests.
- `/health` - Accumulating all health check procedures in the application.

To check that the {productName} is working as expected:

* access the `http://localhost:9990/health/live` endpoint using your browser or
`curl http://localhost:9990/health/live`

All of the health REST endpoints return a simple JSON object with two fields:

* `status` -- the overall result of all the health check procedures
* `checks` -- an array of individual checks

The general `status` of the health check is computed as a logical AND of all the
declared health check procedures. The `checks` array is empty as we have not specified
any health check procedure yet so let's define some.

NOTE: Similarly you can access `http://localhost:9990/health/ready` and
`http://localhost:9990/health`

Congratulations! You successfully deployed and run this quickstart. If you wish to
create the application step by step you can follow the subsequent sections.

== Creating the Maven Project

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
mvn archetype:generate \
    -DgroupId=org.wildfly.quickstart.microprofile.health \
    -DartifactId=microprofile-health \
    -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart
cd microprofile-health
----

Open the project in your favourite IDE.

Open the generated `pom.xml`.

The first thing to do is to setup our dependencies. Add the following section to your
`pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <!-- importing the jakartaee8-with-tools BOM adds specs and other useful artifacts as managed dependencies -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.wildfly.bom</groupId>
      <artifactId>wildfly-jakartaee8-with-tools</artifactId>
      <version>${version.server.bom}</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

where `${version.server.bom}` is the version of your {productName}, in our case
"{productVersion}".

Now we need to add the following two dependencies:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- Import the MicroProfile Health API, we use provided scope as the API is included in WildFly -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile.health</groupId>
  <artifactId>microprofile-health-api</artifactId>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
<!-- Import the CDI API, we use provided scope as the API is included in JBoss EAP -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>jakarta.enterprise</groupId>
  <artifactId>jakarta.enterprise.cdi-api</artifactId>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

NOTE: Because MicroProfile Health requires that all health checks are defined as
CDI beans we need to also include the CDI API dependency.

Both dependencies can have provided scope. The versions are taken from the above
defined BOM.

As we are going to be deploying this application to the {productName} server, let's
also add a maven plugin that will simplify the deployment operations (you can replace
the generated build section):

[source,xml]
----
<build>
  <!-- Set the name of the archive -->
  <finalName>${project.artifactId}</finalName>
  <plugins>
    <!-- Allows to use mvn wildfly:deploy -->
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.wildfly.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>wildfly-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
----

Now we are ready to start working with MicroProfile Health.

== Creating your first health check

In this section, we create our first simple health check procedure.

Create the `org.microprofile.quickstart.health.SimpleHealthCheck` class:

[source,java]
----
package org.wildfly.quickstart.microprofile.health;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponse;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Liveness;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@Liveness
@ApplicationScoped
public class SimpleHealthCheck implements HealthCheck {

    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        return HealthCheckResponse.up("Simple health check");
    }
}
----

As you can see health check procedures are defined as implementations of the
`HealthCheck` interface which are defined as CDI beans with the one of the
following CDI qualifiers:

- `@Liveness` - the liveness check accessible at `/health/live`
- `@Readiness` - the readiness check accessible at `/health/ready`

`HealthCheck` is a functional interface whose single method `call` returns a
`HealthCheckResponse` object which can be easily constructed by the fluent builder
API shown in the example.

Now it's time to build and deploy our application that contains this health check
to the {productName} server.

WARN: Make sure your {productName} server is started.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package wildfly:deploy
----

Now we can simply repeat the request
to `http://localhost:9990/health/live` by refreshing your browser window or by
using `curl http://localhost:9990/health/live`. Because we defined our health check
to be a liveness procedure (with `@Liveness` qualifier) the new health check procedure
is now present in the `checks` array.

Congratulations! You've created your first health check procedure. Let's
continue by exploring what else can be done with the MicroProfile Health specification.

== Adding a readiness health check procedure

In the previous section, we created a simple liveness health check procedure which
states whether our application is running or not. In this section, we will create a
readiness health check which will be able to state whether our application is able to
process requests.

We will create another health check procedure that simulates a connection to
an external service provider such as a database. For starters, we will always return
the response indicating the application is ready.

Create `org.wildfly.quickstart.microprofile.health.DatabaseConnectionHealthCheck` class:

[source,java]
----
package org.wildfly.quickstart.microprofile.health;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponse;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Readiness;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@Readiness
@ApplicationScoped
public class DatabaseConnectionHealthCheck implements HealthCheck {

    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        return HealthCheckResponse.up("Database connection health check");
    }
}
----

Now you can redeploy your application:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package wildfly:deploy
----

If you now rerun the health check at `http://localhost:9990/health/live` the `checks`
array will contain only the previously defined `SimpleHealthCheck` as it is the only
check defined with the `@Liveness` qualifier. However, if you access
`http://localhost:9990/health/ready` (in the browser or with
`curl http://localhost:9990/health/ready`) you will see only the
`Database connection health check` as it is the only health check defined with the
`@Readiness` qualifier as the readiness health check procedure.

NOTE: If you access `http://localhost:9990/health` you will get back both checks.

More information about which health check procedures should be used in which situation
is detailed in the MicroProfile Health specification. Generally, the liveness
procedures determine whether the application should be restarted while readiness
procedures determine whether it makes sense to contact the application with requests.


== Negative health check procedures

In this section, we extend our `Database connection health check` with the option of
stating that our application is not ready to process requests as the underlying
database connection cannot be established. For simplicity reasons, we only determine
whether the database is accessible or not by a configuration property.

To use MicroProfile Config configuration values we first need to add the Config API
dependency to our application:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- Import the MicroProfile Config API, we use provided scope as the API is included in WildFly -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile.config</groupId>
  <artifactId>microprofile-config-api</artifactId>
  <version>1.3</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

Update the `org.wildfly.quickstart.microprofile.health.DatabaseConnectionHealthCheck` class:

[source,java]
----
package org.wildfly.quickstart.microprofile.health;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponse;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponseBuilder;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Readiness;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.inject.Inject;

@Readiness
@ApplicationScoped
public class DatabaseConnectionHealthCheck implements HealthCheck {

    @Inject
    @ConfigProperty(name = "database.up", defaultValue = "false")
    private boolean databaseUp;

    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {

        HealthCheckResponseBuilder responseBuilder = HealthCheckResponse.named("Database connection health check");

        try {
            simulateDatabaseConnectionVerification();
            responseBuilder.up();
        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
            // cannot access the database
            responseBuilder.down();
        }

        return responseBuilder.build();
    }

    private void simulateDatabaseConnectionVerification() {
        if (!databaseUp) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Cannot contact database");
        }
    }
}
----

Redeploy your application:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package wildfly:deploy
----

If you now rerun the readiness health check (at `http://localhost:9990/health/ready`)
the overall `status` should be DOWN. You can also check the liveness check at
`http://localhost:9990/health/live` which will return the overall `status` UP because
it isn't influenced by the readiness checks.

As we shouldn't leave this application with a readiness check in a DOWN state you can
add `database.up=true` in `src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`
and redeploy the application. The readiness health check should be up again.


== Adding user-specific data to the health check response

In previous sections, we saw how to create simple health checks with only the minimal
attributes, namely, the health check name and its status (UP or DOWN). However, the
MicroProfile specification also provides a way for the applications to supply
arbitrary data in the form of key-value pairs sent to the consuming end. This can be
done by using the `withData(key, value)` method of the health check response
builder API.

Let's create a new health check procedure
`org.wildfly.quickstart.microprofile.health.DataHealthCheck`:

[source,java]
----
package org.wildfly.quickstart.microprofile.health;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Liveness;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponse;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@Liveness
@ApplicationScoped
public class DataHealthCheck implements HealthCheck {

    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        return HealthCheckResponse.named("Health check with data")
                .up()
                .withData("foo", "fooValue")
                .withData("bar", "barValue")
                .build();
    }
}
----

If you redeploy and rerun the liveness health check procedure by accessing the
`/health/live` endpoint you can see that the new health check `Health check with data`
is present in the `checks` array. This check contains a new attribute called `data`
which is a JSON object consisting of the properties we have defined in our health
check procedure.

This functionality is specifically useful in failure scenarios where you can pass the
error along with the health check response.


[source,java]
----
        try {
            simulateDatabaseConnectionVerification();
            responseBuilder.up();
        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
            // cannot access the database
            responseBuilder.down()
                    .withData("error", e.getMessage()); // pass the exception message
        }
----

== Conclusion

MicroProfile Health provides a way for your application to distribute information
about its healthiness state to state whether or not it is able to function properly.
Liveness checks are utilized to tell whether the application should be restarted and
readiness checks are used to tell whether the application is able to process requests.

Congratulations! You have reached the end of this tutorial. You can find more information
